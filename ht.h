 * think, but two good reasons to use them are:
 * a) simplifying a type by removing the `struct` portion of the type;
 * b) abstracting away the pointer portion of the type, if users of the type
 * only pass the pointer around as a "handle" and never access its contents.
 *
 * We have done so here.  In other words, the external users of the hash table
 * data type may forget that under the hood, it is a pointer to a structure.
